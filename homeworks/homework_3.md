Read Chapter 3 in your textbook and the relevant lecture slides. Answer the questions below individually. The goal is to have you think about the problems, not cover every eventuality. Shoot for short, succinct answers that address the root of the question. Please, submit your typed answers as pdf/txt into the Dropbox on D2L into the “HW 3” folder.
1. [2 points] If all the links in the Internet were reliable, would the TCP reliable delivery service be redundant? Why or why not?
2. [2 points] If you are to develop an application that sends high quality images from one end to another, would you prefer TCP or UDP? Explain, why you have selected that protocol (TCP/UDP)? Put some strong arguments.
3. [2 points] In the rdt protocols described in class (and covered in textbook Section 3.4) what is the purpose of sequence numbers and of timers.
4. [4 points] UDP and TCP use 1s complement for their checksum. Suppose you have the following three 8-bit bytes: 01010011, 01100110, 01110111. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 8-bit bytes? Why is it that UDP takes the 1s complement of the sum: that is, why not just use the sum? With the 1s complement scheme, how does the receiver detect errors? Is it possible that a 1-bit error will go undetected?
5. [5 points] List all possible Congestion Control mechanism considering the following image and explain all of them in detail.
